# About My-public-repo

In this repo you can find 4 projects that I developed in the bootcamp.

The server project is a project where I had to create a server for the first time.

The multiChat project is a project that allows people to comunicate, a multi-threaded program.

The BeerGame is a project that was developed by me and other 4 creators (@irenesil,@SeanHRKong,@dianamarinho,@antoniomeloferreira), in our 4th week of bootcamp, meaning 3rd week of Java.

The RandomLovers is a webapp that was developed during the Hackathon, me and my team (@catarinaRibas,@zm-dksg,@dianamarinho,@o-mego) had 24h to develop a webapp and this was the final result.
